### **3. Level Assessment Algorithm**
�� Scoring System (0-100 points total):
Books Completed (0-30 points): 3 points per book, max 30
Total Pages Read (0-25 points): 1 point per 100 pages, max 25
Daily Consistency (0-20 points):
50+ pages/day = 20 points
30+ pages/day = 15 points
20+ pages/day = 10 points
10+ pages/day = 5 points
Achievements (0-15 points): 2 points per achievement, max 15

Reading Streak (0-10 points):
100+ days = 10 points
30+ days = 7 points
7+ days = 5 points
3+ days = 3 points
1+ days = 1 point
�� Reading Levels:
Beginner (0-19 points): New to reading
Novice (20-39 points): Building reading habits
Intermediate (40-59 points): Consistent reader
Advanced (60-79 points): Experienced reader
Master (80+ points): Reading expert
Automatic Updates:
Reading level is recalculated every time the profile is updated
Level changes are logged for tracking
System considers all user metrics for fair assessment
